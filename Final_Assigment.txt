Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table =  10000 
ii. Business table =  10000 
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table =  10000 
v. elite_years table =  10000 
vi. friend table =  10000 
vii. hours table =  10000
viii. photo table =   10000 
ix. review table =  10000 
x. tip table =   10000 
xi. user table =  10000 
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business =  id: 10000
ii. Hours =  business_id: 1562
iii. Category = business_id: 2643
iv. Attribute = business_id: 1115
v. Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = business_id: 493
vii. Photo =  id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. Tip =  user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. User =   id: 10000
x. Friend =  user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years = user_id: 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM user
		WHERE id IS NULL OR 
		  name IS NULL OR 
		  review_count IS NULL OR 
		  yelping_since IS NULL OR

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1.0	max:	5.0	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min:	0	max:	2	avg: 0.0144 
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count

SELECT sqlite_version();



City = Toronto	
Category = Food
		

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. 
Include your code.

City = Toronto	
Category = Food
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Better reviewed business tends to open later and not for such a long time.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The more reviews they have the more likely to have better star rating
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Every business has different postal code and probe is not large so I can't infer anything with high accuracy.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  B.name,
			   B.review_count,
			   H.hours,
			   postal_code,
        CASE WHEN stars <=3 THEN '2-3 stars'
             WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
        ELSE 'excluded' END AS ranking
FROM business B INNER JOIN hours H
		ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C
		ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE (B.city == 'Toronto'
		AND
		C.category LIKE 'Food')
		AND
		(B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3
		OR
		B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5)
		GROUP BY stars
		ORDER BY ranking ASC


		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed?
 List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

AVG star for open
+---------------------+
| ROUND(AVG(stars),2) |
+---------------------+
|                3.68 |
+---------------------+

AVG for is closed
+---------------------+
| ROUND(AVG(stars),2) |
+---------------------+
|                3.52 |
+---------------------+
         

Avg star rating for those who are open are higher than for closed.
         
ii. Difference 2:

Open business are much more wider by states for open than closed.
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT ROUND(AVG(stars),2) FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1; 

SELECT ROUND(AVG(stars),2) FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0; 


SELECT state, COUNT(state)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 0
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY COUNT(state) DESC; 


SELECT state, COUNT(state)
FROM business
WHERE is_open = 1
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY COUNT(state) DESC; 



	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
Problem: We have found investor who want to open new business, 
he wants to take quick review of open businesses which are in Arizona or Nevada but he does not want to open in Las Vegas.

His main goal was to spot his competition with star rating above 3.5 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I had to show name, address, city, stars and review count, and category

Filtering data based on client's requirements (mentioned in paragraph i)
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
